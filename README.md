#Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a 3x3 grid-based game where two players take turns marking spaces with X or O. The goal is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
This console-based implementation features a two-player mode, input validation, win detection, and draw handling.
Built in C, it's a simple yet engaging project to explore fundamental programming concepts.
